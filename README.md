- 👋 Hi, I’m @clingerchris
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Analytics. Discovering and utilizing patterns in our environment is the key to progress. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a sophomore at Brigham Young University, studying Statistics & Data Science. I am in the process of learning C++, with plans to learn R, Python, and PostgreSQL. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything in C++ (for now).
